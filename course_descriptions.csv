It involves many complex concepts and calculations that we teach in this Technical Analysis course. Here’s a peek at what you’ll learn.

The valuation of a security depends on the activity of rational and irrational market participants. Some investors are led by their emotions or “animal spirits.” A bull represents an investor’s optimism, and a bear—their pessimism about a particular security or the market in general. When investors feel bullish, stock prices go up. Reversely, when investors feel bearish, stock prices go down. 

Since the market is under the influence of such social-behavioral phenomena, it is not always efficient. So, we need technical analysis to study collective investor psychology.

Data Analysis with ChatGPT,data-analysis-with-chatgpt,chatgpt,"Leverage ChatGPT's Advanced Data Analysis Code Interpreter to outpace competitors in a rapidly evolving landscape.
Today, ChatGPT is the most exciting office productivity tool globally. Unsurprisingly, the demand for professionals navigating this software has been surging exponentially.
The Problem
It’s challenging to acquire practical skills that will teach you how to leverage ChatGPT and AI at work. Most ChatGPT courses focus on generic prompt engineering and cannot build the bridge between basic prompting and practical implementation that will boost your productivity on the job.
The Solution
This Data Analysis with ChatGPT course teaches you how to effectively utilize ChatGPT for data analysis throughout the entire data analysis lifecycle:
-	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-	Data preprocessing
-	Data analysis
-	Data visualization
-	Data interpretation
Each topic seamlessly builds upon the previous one, and the practical example that unfolds throughout the course allows you to see the bigger picture and understand how ChatGPT can help you in a real-world working environment.
Data Analysis with ChatGPT in Excel
Excel is the world’s most popular office productivity and data analysis tool. We’ll use Excel files to input data to ChatGPT and evaluate its output. The same principles apply if you use other tools like Python, R, Tableau, and Power BI for data analysis.
Why Take the Course?
A common social media statement declares, ‘’AI won’t replace you, but those embracing AI will,” underscoring the need to welcome change. Progress and new technologies are unstoppable, so we must adapt and boost productivity with available, effective tools

Prompt engineering in AI tools like ChatGPT shows remarkable promise in the data analysis field. Once you become familiar with its capabilities, you’ll appreciate that ChatGPT democratizes data analysis and makes it easier for individuals unfamiliar with Python or advanced Excel modeling.
