While its syntax is intuitive, not everyone has the time—or the need—to learn it from scratch. Sometimes, you just want to quickly find specific information in a database without depending on developers or technical experts. With ChatGPT, you can do that—on your own.  \\r\\nThis course is designed for complete beginners who want to work with databases using SQL—without getting bogged down in its syntax. It’s also ideal for those who already know the language but want to improve their speed and efficiency.\\r\\nWe'll show you how to use ChatGPT as your personal SQL assistant. The AI will help you write, understand, and modify MySQL queries, as well as analyse data. You’ll learn how to navigate MySQL Workbench, explore tables, and extract meaningful insights.\\r\\nAll of this with our fast-track, one-hour course.\", \"Course launch in \\n                Aug\\n               \\n                2025\\n                \\n        Upcoming courses\\n        \\n        ChatGPT for SQL Beginners\\n       with Ivan Manov Do you want to quickly extract information from a database using SQL?
